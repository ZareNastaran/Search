# Search
Here are are the search engine projects
I started with the simpleset way, keyword search as my first project. In this project, I tried to let user saerch for a book title and show them the most relevent result. first I calculated the cosine similarity between the query and book titles and then I multiply the similarity score with average rating and number of rating so I can show the most relevent results.
